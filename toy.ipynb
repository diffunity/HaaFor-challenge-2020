It's an important win for Qualcomm and builds on its momentum from a recent injunction in China, yet we don't think a victory in this battle will put enough pressure on Apple to settle the global dispute in the near term.\"\"\",\n",
    "\"\"\"Trump, speaking at his Bedminster, New Jersey, golf club, had claimed again that he is the one who got the Veterans Choice program passed -- adding, \"They've been trying to get that passed for decades and decades and decades and no president's ever been able to do it, and we got it done.\" In fact, former President Barack Obama signed the Choice program into law in 2014. The law, which allowed eligible veterans to be covered by the government for care provided by doctors outside the VA system, was a bipartisan initiative spearheaded by two senators Trump has repeatedly criticized, Bernie Sanders of Vermont and the late John McCain of Arizona. What Trump signed was a 2018 law, the VA MISSION Act, that modified and expanded the eligibility criteria from the Choice program. Rather than tout that bill, Trump has claimed over and over that he created Veterans Choice itself -- after others had failed for \"50 years.\" \"\"\",\n",
    "\"\"\"By this time of year, the rice growing on Bao Wentao's family farm should have been ready to harvest. Instead, heavy flooding has engulfed huge swathes of southern China, including more than 36 acres of rice fields that 19-year-old Bao and his father tend to in their village near Poyang Lake. \"The crops have completely failed,\" Bao told CNN Business in an interview over the social media app WeChat, adding that his family has already lost roughly 200,000 yuan ($28,000) worth of produce. \"The rice was nearly ripened and ready to harvest before the flooding. But now everything is gone.\" Surging floodwater burst the banks of Poyang Lake in Jiangxi province last month, destroying thousands of acres of farmland in what's known as the \"land of fish and rice.\" The broader Yangtze River basin — which includes Poyang Lake and stretches more than 3,900 miles from Shanghai in the east to the Tibetan border in the west — accounts for 70% of the country's rice production.\"\"\"]\n",

In a career that spanned more than two decades, Harris battled many of wrestling's superstars, including Hulk Hogan, The Undertaker and Andre the Giant, according to the release. \"He terrorized opponents and thrilled audiences in Mid-South, World Class Championship Wrestling, WCW and WWE until 2006,\" the WWE said.
