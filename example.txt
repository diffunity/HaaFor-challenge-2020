Qualcomm's Win Over Apple in Germany Won't Force Apple to Table
Qualcomm's win over Apple in Germany, which if upheld will block the sale of some older model iPhones in Germany, could reduce Apple's quarterly sales by about $560 million, in our estimation. It's an important win for Qualcomm and builds on its momentum from a recent injunction in China, yet we don't think a victory in this battle will put enough pressure on Apple to settle the global dispute in the near term.
Qualcomm's Germany Offensive Coming Up Short in Apple Row
Qualcomm is losing steam in Germany with every decision that falls short of entirely blocking Apple's most popular iPhone models from being sold there. So far no judge has gone that far, with a Jan. 15 Mannheim court ruling in Apple's favor the latest setback for Qualcomm. The company sued Apple in Germany because the nation frequently grants broad injunctive relief in patent cases. We think Apple is likely to escape meaningful harm in Germany.
